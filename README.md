# not-create-react-app
A simple bash script to automate creating a new React based project and opening the VS Code text editor.

<br />

## Description:
The main goal for this script is to eventually have it call a node script that will log the user in to github, create a repository and publish the fresh project to the newly created repository.

<br />

## Getting Started:
```bash

# cloning the repository.

git clone https://github.com/damiensedgwick/not-create-react-app.git

# change directory into the project folder and move create script to bin folder

cd not-create-react-app

# change the project path variable so that the output is where you would like the project to out to.

# change script permissions so that you can execute it
chmod +x ./create

./create project-name # from the project directory and if you haven't added the script to your path

# selete the option you wish to proceed with and #Profit

```
<br />

## Contributions
