# not-create-react-app
A simple bash script to automate creating a new React based project and opening the VS Code text editor.

<br />

## Description:
The main goal for this script is to eventually have it call a node script that will log the user in to github, create a repository and publish the fresh project to the newly created repository.

<br />

## Getting Started:
```bash

# cloning the repository.

git clone https://github.com/damiensedgwick/not-create-react-app.git

# change directory into the project folder and move create script to bin folder

cd not-create-react-app

mv create /Users/username/bin # MacOS

mv create /home/username/bin # Linux

```
<br />

## Contributions
If you have a suggestion for the script then please get in touch and let me know and likewise, if you would like to contribute, please do not hesitate to do so.
